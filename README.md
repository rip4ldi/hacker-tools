Includes:
- a [file encrypter/decrypter](/cryptography/crypto.py)
- an [one-time pad XOR cipher](/cryptography/xor_encryption.py)
- [working ransomware .py files and client executables](/cryptography/ransomware/)
- a (very slow) [port scanner](/port_scanner.py) 
- a [reverse shell](/reverse_shell) that *might* work
- a [FTP password cracker](/ftp_cracker.py)
- a [fully functional keylogger](/keylogger.py)
- a [program that will destroy your computer](/cpu_bane.py)


I really appreciate Abdou Rockikz [(thepythoncode.com)](https://thepythoncode.com/) and his awesome articles that helped me make many of these!
